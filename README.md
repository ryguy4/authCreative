# Midterm-2

During this midterm you will implement an Angular front end along with a Node.js backend with Express and Mongo.  You should sign up for a time to take the exam and when you arrive at the TA cubicle in the basement of the Talmage Building at that time, you will be handed an assignment sheet with the exam specifications.  You will then write your code and pass it off with the TA within 3 hours of starting.

You can use previous labs and documentation from the internet to get ideas, but the coding should be your own.  You can use your own code for previous projects, but you must not copy code from the internet or from another student.

Sign up for the exam here.

When you have finished the exam, you will pass it off with a TA and he will record your score.

You will also submit your URL for your application and the github repo URL in Canvas.
